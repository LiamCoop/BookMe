# Design Characteristics & Visual Direction  
**Project:** Service Booking & Management Platform for Small Businesses

---

## 1. Brand Personality & Tone

The product should feel:

- **Friendly and approachable** — welcoming to both business owners and customers.
- **Professional, but not corporate** — trustworthy without feeling stiff or enterprise-y.
- **Calm and minimal** — clarity and ease over flashiness.
- **Neutral and flexible** — suitable for a wide range of service businesses (salons, repair services, consultants, etc.).

The goal is to create confidence and comfort:  
> “This is easy to use, thoughtfully designed, and won’t get in my way.”

## 2. Color Palette

### Overall Direction
- Soft, pastel-forward color palette.
- Muted and tasteful rather than bold or high-contrast.
- Avoid neon, highly saturated, or overly trendy color combinations.

### Primary Colors
- Pastel blues, greens, lavenders, or dusty pinks.
- Used for primary actions, highlights, and key UI moments.

### Accent Colors
- Slightly stronger (but still muted) pastel tones.
- Used sparingly for emphasis, active states, or important indicators.

### Neutral Colors
- Off-white backgrounds (e.g. #F7F7F7 or similar).
- Soft grays for borders, dividers, and secondary UI.
- Dark gray or charcoal for text (avoid pure black where possible).

### Usage Notes
- Rely on **contrast through tone and spacing**, not strong color jumps.
- Primary CTAs should be visible but not aggressive.
- Secondary actions should feel intentionally quieter.
